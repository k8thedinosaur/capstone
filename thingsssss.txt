~how to add item's name to tossed list on delete? (or just before delete? function inside delete?)
	(maybe...create new model classes for "used" and "tossed", and item is moved/assigned to one or the other on button click; tossed list is displayed and used list is not user-interactable [same as deleted, except not])
	(or...boolean field "tossed" vs regular delete for used)~

~how to get filters to work? (more reading, blerg [or do like humans do and watch a youtube])~

~split into template blah-blah, drag css over from codepen~

~figure out how to exclude tossed items from fridge item view, since they are not deleted~

~how to delete objects on-page~




in Models > Items
can "expires" be made into an if/else statement to apply a default value based on category chosen?

how to aggregate time (count between date_added and expires) and/or make action happen when date item expires is reached?
	(research timedelta further)

possible answers to time problem:
	get seconds of expiry date and added date, write function to subtract them, add this output as another variable to be operated on


to do:

find new font
~make small modals taller (match height of large)~
~style add item~
~style scrollbars, x's, buttons~
~tossed category text bold~
~cursor change on clickable things~
~add clear all button to tossed list~

~draw inside of fridge door~

make all the dumb little pictures \0/ /0\



bonus:
~make icons move on hover~
change date display format
style forms
	get calendar to appear next to date inputs
draw "easter egg" behind shopping list
draw something coming out of the shopping bag
